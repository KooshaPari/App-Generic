# App Generic
## For use as a boilerplate for future apps, suited mostly for utility style apps.

This is an incomplete project from a client that got me started with React Native.
I'm chronically lazy and love to have my programs built up as modules that I can just "customize",
so I'm now converting this into a sort of boilerplate to simplify my future projects
and help me get a better hand in RN as well as general mobile development. 

The code right now is very badly done and cobbled together, so as I get time I'll be refactoring
everything to be a bit better and more readable, then mapping out how I'm actually structuring this template.
